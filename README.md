## Coup (with poker cards)

### TERMINOLOGY

- *Draw pile*: Pile of cards, face down
- *Discard pile*: Another pile of cards, face down
- *Reveal*: show everyone
- *Draw*: Take from the draw pile (not revealing to others)
- *Replace*: Put a card in the discard, and replace it with a card from the draw.
- *Target*: Point at a particular card
- *Disabled*: When a card is disabled, it should be turned 90 degrees.
- *Death*:  When a card in play "dies", it gets discarded and does *not* get replaced.

### SETUP

- shuffle the deck (no jokers)
- each player draws 2 cards (alt: 3 cards), looking at it and placing it face down in front of them

The discard pile starts empty.  Any card that leaves play goes into the discard pile.
If the draw pile is ever empty, shuffle the discard pile to make a new draw pile.

### GAMEPLAY

Players take turns.  On each turn, the player takes $1.  Then, they choose exactly one of the following:
- Take $1 additional money
- Pay $1 to swap out one of your *non-disabled* cards, drawing a new card from the deck
- Pay $7 to target an enemy card to coup.  That card is discarded
- Draw 2 cards.  If either was a heart, un-disable a disabled card.
- Announce a card, and a number of times to use its activity ability.
At any given time, a player may choose a relevant passive ability and use it some number of times, as well.
In both cases, the number of times an ability is used should be declared ahead of time.
You cannot use the same passive ability multiple times in a row.

Immediately after any (active or passive) ability is used, a player may claim it is a bluff.
Then, the original player may reveal N *non-disabled* cards with that ability, where N is the
number of times the ability was used.
- If they successfully do so, they replace those N cards, and the challenger must lose a card.
- If they do not do so, they choose a card to lose, and the challenger gets $5.

When a player loses their last card, they lose.  Last player standing wins.
